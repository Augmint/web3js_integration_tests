# Basic web3js and ganache integration tests (WIP)

## Why?

Each new [web3js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) 1.0 beta release breaks our [projects](https://github.com/Augmint) in multiple different ways. It essentially makes us stuck with beta36.
Intention is to gradually build up tests with all breaking issues we encounter so we will do manually test of a new release only if these tests are passing.

## Setup

`yarn install`

## Run

`yarn ganache:run` then `yarn test`
